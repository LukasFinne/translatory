# Translatory 

Is an work-in-progress image to translation 

My Idea is to create a website/app that analyzes an Image and get and translate the text as well as separate the individuals words
and then process these words into format that can be imported into to the Anki. So I could practice and learn the meanings. 


Technologies/Libraries used:
